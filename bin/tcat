# tcat - Bourne Shell Templates
# =============================
#
# A template processor that substitutes environment variables and bourne shell
# fragments during processing. It sits about halfway between envsubst and
# jinja2.
#
# Compared to envsubst, it has a richer set of variable expansions, including
# command substitution.
#
# WARNING: "command substitution" implies data is executable. In other words
# tcat has almost unlimited power over the files in your home directory. It
# must never be used to expand untrusted templates.
#
# Tutorial
# --------
#
# tcat works by transforming the input files into bourne shell "here
# documents".  That means that variable substitution works the same way that
# it does in bourne shell.
#
#     Simple variable expansion can be $RAW or be ${BRACKETED}.
#
#     $(echo Command substitution) works just like it does in the shell and
#     can use bracketed or `echo backtick` syntax.
#
#     Here documents do not expand 'single-' or "double-quoted" strings. This
#     means no special treatment is needed to process documents that contain
#     these characters. In fact the only symbols that need to be escaped are
#     \$ and \` .
#
#     ${DEFAULTS:-are expressed} using POSIX default value syntax. This
#     expands either to 'are expressed' if DEFAULT is unset, otherwise it it
#     expands to the content of DEFAULT).
#
#     ${UNSET:?variables can also trigger error reporting}. This allows a
#     template to report an error if a mandatory option is overlooked.
#
#     $(include subtemplate.tc) is a simple command substitution but the
#     include function is defined by tcat itself. It allows templates to refer
#     to other templates and be expanded in the same way.
#
#     $(cat file.raw) is similar but does not do any variable substitution.
#
# Example
# -------
#
# This is a self-referential example that shows how this file can be merged
# into a HTML header/footer template. In this example the header and footer
# are trivial but in a real example.
#
# README.html.tc:
#
#     $(include header.html.tc)
#
#     <!-- Extract the markdown from the tcat script and convert it to html -->
#     $(egrep '^#($| )' tcat | cut -b3- | cmark)
#
#     $(include footer.html.tc)
#
# header.html.tc:
#
#     <!DOCTYPE html>
#     <html>
#     <head>
#       <title>tcat v${VERSION:?is missing}</title>
#     </head>
#     <body>
#
# footer.html.tc
#
#     </body>
#     </html>
